### Explanation of the Code

#### Overview

This project consists of a user-space application and a Linux kernel module. The goal is to read and display system information such as the version, CPU details, memory usage, and uptime through a `/proc` file interface.

#### User-Space Application

1. **`userinput()` Function**:
   - This function handles user input to determine which information the user wants to retrieve: version, CPU details, memory usage, time, or all available data. 
   - Based on the user's selection, the function sets the appropriate row range and calls the `information()` function to fetch the required data.

2. **`information()` Function**:
   - This function reads the data from the `/proc/my_info` file.
   - It filters the data based on the user's input to display only the requested information or all the information if requested.
   - The data is read line by line, and relevant lines are printed to the console.

#### Kernel Module

1. **Kernel Module Overview**:
   - The kernel module creates a `/proc` entry called `my_info`. When this file is accessed, it provides system information, including the Linux version, CPU specifications, memory usage, and uptime.

2. **Sequence File Operations**:
   - The kernel module uses a sequence file interface to handle the reading of system information.
   - **`my_seq_start()`, `my_seq_next()`, `my_seq_stop()`**: These functions manage the start, iteration, and stop of reading data in sequence.
   - **`my_seq_show()`**: This function is called for each step of the sequence and is responsible for printing the system information to the `/proc` file.

3. **System Information Gathering**:
   - The module gathers various system metrics:
     - **Version**: Kernel and system version information.
     - **CPU**: Details about the CPU cores, such as processor ID, core ID, and cache size.
     - **Memory**: Information about total memory, free memory, buffers, active/inactive memory, and more.
     - **Time**: Uptime and idle time of the system.

4. **`my_open()` Function**:
   - This function is called when the `/proc/my_info` file is opened. It sets up the sequence operations to handle the data reading.

5. **Module Initialization and Cleanup**:
   - The module creates the `/proc/my_info` entry during initialization and removes it during cleanup.

6. **Module License**:
   - The module is licensed under the GPL, ensuring that it is open-source and freely distributable.

#### Summary

This project demonstrates the integration of a user-space application with a custom Linux kernel module to provide system information through the `/proc` filesystem. The user-space application interacts with the kernel module by reading from a `/proc` entry, allowing users to request specific system metrics interactively.
